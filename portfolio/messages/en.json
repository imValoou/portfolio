I love to explore, test, compare, and continuously learn.</paragraph><paragraph>I work with modern technologies like React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Angular, and Flutter, but I am also comfortable with more traditional stacks such as PHP/MySQL, .NET/C#, or PostgreSQL. On the mobile and native side, I use Kotlin, and for tooling, I leverage Copilot, Firebase, and anything that helps me move faster without compromising quality.</paragraph><paragraph>I donâ€™t limit myself to one framework or stack: I like to understand how things work under the hood, and I strive to be versatile, autonomous, and able to adapt to any environment.</paragraph>"
